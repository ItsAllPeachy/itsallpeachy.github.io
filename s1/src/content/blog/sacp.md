# What Is The SCAP, A brief history
 
 
The SACP `(South African Communist Party)` Is a Far Left wing communist party based in South Africa. It was originally founded on the 12th of February 1921. It was formed by the International Socialist League merging with a collection of other various smaller socialist groups to create the CPSA `(Communist Party of South Africa)` under the leadership of William H. Andrews, who after the groups conception took the role of the chairman.
 
In 1950 the CPSA was forced underground due to the Apartheid government implementing the `1950 Suppression Of Communism Act` to prevent the spread of communist throughout South Africa, and to stunt the Anti-apartheid movements that the CPSA and other Communist organisations were commonly associated with, and in some cases even provided funding for. The CPSA going underground is what lead to it's name being changed from the `Communist Party of South Africa` to the `South African Communist Party` as it's known today in its 1953 reconstitution.
 
On 2nd of February in 1990, when the then president F W. De Klerk announced the unbanning of the SACP the ANC and any other major political parties, it marked a pivotal moment in south African transition from a Undemocratic Apartheid regime to a new, more democratic era in the countries history. The unbanning of political parties ushered in a new era of political discussion and dialogue, Ultimately resulting in the open and democratic 1994 election, which is what directly lead to the collapse of the Apartheid regime in South Africa.
